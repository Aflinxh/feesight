In today's fast-paced world, managing personal finances is a challenge for many, especially among Gen-Z and millennials. With consumerism on the rise, driven by social media and e-commerce, many individuals find themselves tempted to spend on entertainment, dining, and other non-essential items. This often leads to financial stress, uncertainty, and unexpected expenses, particularly when incomes are just enough to meet basic needs.

Traditional financial apps fall short in helping users accurately forecast their future expenses and manage their discretionary income. FeeSight is here to fill that gap.
